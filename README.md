## Project Description

In this project, we have built a comprehensive Todo Application that includes all essential features. We have implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The application is developed using React.js, and for state management, we have utilized Redux. Additionally, we've incorporated simple animations using Framer Motion. This project is beginner-friendly and designed to help you learn the fundamentals of building a React-based Todo application. We hope you enjoy using it!
